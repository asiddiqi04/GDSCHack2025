# 🌱 GreenScore

**GreenScore** is a barcode-scanning tool and search assistant that helps users make more ethical and sustainable food choices — powered by AI and built for impact.

---

## 🌟 Inspiration

We were inspired by the rising demand for ethical consumerism and the growing frustration around how difficult it is to make truly informed shopping decisions.

> Greenwashed packaging, vague eco-labels, and hidden supply chain issues often leave well-intentioned shoppers in the dark.

**GreenScore** aims to bring clarity and accountability to the food industry — helping users align their purchases with their values in a simple, confident way.

## 🤖 What It Does

GreenScore analyzes a product’s **environmental footprint**, **labour ethics**, **ingredient sourcing**, and **health impact**, and returns:

- ✅ A **GreenScore** (0–100)
- 📋 A concise **summary** of sustainability, ethics, and health factors
- 📉 A list of **pros, cons, and verified facts**
- 🔁 **Recommended alternatives** with better scores
- 💬 An **AI-powered chatbot assistant** that answers questions and suggests better options on the go

Users can either:
- **📷 Scan a barcode** using their device camera
- **🔍 Search a product name** to get instant feedback
